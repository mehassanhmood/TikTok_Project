## Plan :
1. Goal: To determine whether a video contains a claim or whther it offers an opinion.
2. Strategies utilized:
   1. Data Source: Gathered with in from the organization (first party) and provided as a csv.
   2. KPIs: Would depend on the insights covered via statistical inferences and mavhine learning algorithms and their performnace.
   3. Tools: Python, statsmodel, scipy, scikit-learn and various others on need basis.
   4. Deliverables : Dataset scrubbed for EDA, visualizations, statistical model, regression analysis, and/or machine learning.
